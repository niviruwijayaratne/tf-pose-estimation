# Soccer Mechanics Correction

In my opinion, the best soccer players are dominant in 3 categories:
- Athleticism
- Technique
- Soccer IQ

Often times, athleticism is something that comes far more naturally to certain people than it does for others. Soccer IQ, while eventually developed, is a trait that comes through lots of experience and is one that even the elite are still improving upon. <b>Technique</b>, however, is a trait that requires neither natural affinity nor wealth of experience. Given the current circumstances and COVID-19, it is especially hard for players starting out in their soccer journey to get the neccesary training to get their game to the next level. <b>This project aims to provide a simple but effective way for soccer players to perfect their technique and up their game</b>. I'm learning as I go, so this project will be subject to a lot of change. Excited to learn and create what I think would be a very useful tool.
